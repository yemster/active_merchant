    # = Barclays ExtraPlus / DirectLink Gateway
    #
    # Barclays ePDQ is being phased out in favour of a product based on the Ogone
    # DirectLink Gateway, which is being marketed as "Barclays Extra Plus". It 
    # is the API version of the platform, as opposed to the e-commerce hosted 
    # pages of Barclays Extra Plus.
    #
    # This class is based upon the OgoneGateway class as it re-uses the same 
    # architecture, with different endpoints. Please refer to the OgoneGateway 
    # class for more information.
    #
    # == Setup Notes
    #
    # In order to enable API access with BarclaysExtraPlus, an API user 
    # must be created in the Barclays e-commerce backend. This user must have 
    # admin rights, and the checkbox "Special user for API (no access to admin.)"
    #
    # In order to use the ALIAS feature to store authorisations without 
    # storing card details, this feature must be enabled via a support ticket 
    # with Barclays. Then, the ALIAS variable must be added to the list of dynamic
    # parameters on the Technical Information > Transaction Feedback tab, and
    # a SHAOUT signature must be provided. 
    #
    # All the unit and remote tests passed with a BarclaysExtraPlus test account
    # on November 22nd, 2012.
